Cultivate your hunger before you idealize
Motivate your anger to make them all realize
Climbing the mountain, never coming down
Break into the contents, never falling down
My knee is still shaking like I was twelve
Sneaking out the classroom by the back door
A man railed at me twice, though, but I didn't care
Waiting is wasting for people like me
