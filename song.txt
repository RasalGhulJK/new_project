Akeboshi - Wind

(Verse 1)
Cultivate your hunger before you idealize
Motivate your anger to make them all realize
Climbing the mountain, never coming down
Break into the contents, never falling down
My knee is still shaking like I was twelve
Sneaking out the classroom by the back door
A man railed at me twice, though, but I didn't care
Waiting is wasting for people like me

(Verse 2)
You say "Dreams, are dreams"
I ain't gonna play the fool anymore
You say "'Cause I've still got my soul"
Take your time, baby, your blood need slowing down
Breach yourself to reach yourself before you gloom
Reflection of fear make shadows of nothing
Shadows of nothing
You still are blind if you see a winding road
'Cause there's always a straight way to the point you see
